# TGen
Part 5 Item Generator

This program should 1) find appropriate sentences from the Internet to use as stim material for Part 5 items. 2) Parse those sentences and find an appropriate testable word. 3) Generate alternatives. 4) Present the final item in a Web site.

To do:

Finding the sentence -> random sentence generation vs. parse and check a full doc?

There needs to be one repeatable "check" to determine if first, a sentence is suitable (Of appropriate level, not too much punctuation, not too long) and then if the rarest word is also suitable (only a noun, not a proper noun)

Divide project -> HTML, CSS, sentence finder, sentence checker, option maker, cosmetics

A hope for doing grammar items?
